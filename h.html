    <strong>Dear Professor Lee, <br><br>
    
    As I prepare for my journey into the workforce after graduation, I am hoping to gather a general letter of recommendation from you that I can use for future teaching position applications. <br><br>
    
    As my elementary education advisor, mentor, and professor, I believe a reference from you would provide a potential employer with insight into my character and teaching abilities, ensuring them I would be an ideal candidate for the early childhood education position they are looking to fill. <br><br>
    
    If you need any additional information, please contact me via email or phone. If you would kindly provide me with four signed copies of the letter in sealed envelopes with your signature across the seal, I would much appreciate it.<br><br>
    
    Thank you for your consideration and support.<br><br>
    
    Sincerely,<br><br><br>
    Signature<br>
    Chandana<br>
